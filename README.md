CSS Transition Effect applied to a photo gallery

This is a sample webpage I created for a potential photo gallery.  I wanted to create a classic look for the gallery when the user initially navigates to the gallery page.  As they hover over the image, however, it gracefully transitions into a full color diplay and brings the image to life.  

From a functionality standpoint, I defined the duration of the transition (.3s), the transition timing function (ease-in-out), and filter (grayscale @ 100% & grayscale @ 0% when mouse is hovered over image) properties to achieve this effect.
